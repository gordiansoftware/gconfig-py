# MCP Security Rules

**IMPORTANT — Remote MCP Security Rules:**
- **Before using any REMOTE MCP**, ask the user for permission and explain what data will be sent
- **Never send customer data, credentials, API keys, or PII** through remote MCPs
- **Prefer LOCAL MCPs** whenever possible — they process everything on the local machine
- **Remote MCPs are pre-approved for**: code-related queries, documentation lookups, issue tracking, and infrastructure inspection of Gordian-owned resources only

See the root `Ancillaries_Common/CLAUDE.md` for full MCP documentation and security classification.
